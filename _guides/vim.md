I've been using the Vim editor for many years now.

One way of handling the many plugins that are possible is to use a mechanism or tool
that bundles a group of plugins. I've been using[spf-13](https://github.com/spf13/spf13-vim)

This bundle includes:

* [vim-fugitive](https://github.com/tpope/vim-fugitive) for integrating git.
