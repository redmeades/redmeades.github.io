This idea was [proposed by Derek Sivers](http://nownownow.com/about) as a place to respond to
"what you'd tell a friend you hadn't seen in a year"

I'm still coding, not so much drumming, reading, pondering theology, technology
and education. I have been running a lot this year, but am currently recovering
from an injury of sorts.

Our house has  to 3 at school, so the rhythms of the day and week
are changing with a schoolwork and activities and sport.

After our move from [Blackburn
North](https://www.google.com.au/maps/@-37.8046454,145.1462904,15z) out east, we
have moved further out and bought a house in
[Seville](https://www.google.com.au/maps/@-37.7309831,145.4449616,13z) which is
in a delightful location at the base of the [Yarra
Valley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yarra_Valley).

Things are going well at the [University of Divinity](https://divinity.edu.au),
with a number of key projects on the boil bringing together Theology, Education
and Technology.
