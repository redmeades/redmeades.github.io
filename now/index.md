I’m still coding, drumming, reading, pondering.

Our house has transitioned to 3 at school, so the rhythms of the day and week are changing.

This biggest change is that after 10 years in [Blackburn North](https://www.google.com.au/maps/@-37.8046454,145.1462904,15z)
we have shifted to [Montrose](https://www.google.com.au/maps/@-37.8073644,145.3506885,14z).

Most of my time is at [Eastern](https://eastern.edu.au), looking at Education and Technology
as well as teaching in the areas of Old Testament and Interpretation.
