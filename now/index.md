This idea was [proposed by Derek Sivers](http://nownownow.com/about) as a place to respond to

I’m still coding, drumming, reading, pondering.

I have taken up running.

Our house has transitioned to 3 at school, so the rhythms of the day and week are changing.

This biggest change is that after 10 years in [Blackburn North](https://www.google.com.au/maps/@-37.8046454,145.1462904,15z)
we have shifted to [Montrose](https://www.google.com.au/maps/@-37.8073644,145.3506885,14z).

The other big change is that after 10 years at [Tabor/Eastern](https://eastern.edu.au), I have left to take up 
a position at the [University of Divinity](https://divinity.edu.au). I am based at the Office of the Vice-Chancellor,
 looking at Education and Technology.
