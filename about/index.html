<img src="http://dailydropcap.com/images/H-9-cap.png" title="Daily Drop Cap by Jessica Hische" align="left" alt="H" />ow did I get to here?

<br><br><br>I started my career with a mix of web development and systems administration, working for <http://powerserve.com.au> and then at <http://infoxchange.net.au>.

I took time away from web development, studying theology and providing IT support in one of Victoria’s largest primary schools.

After completing studies I worked for <http://www.tear.org.au> as their IT manager and helped to develop the first version of <http://usefulgifts.org>.

An opportunity arose to move back into education and so I became the IT manager for <http://tabor.vic.edu.au>. And here I’ve spent 7 years grappling with the intersection of Theology, Education and Technology.

When people ask what I do, I generally say “my role goes from ‘if it plugs in it is my problem’ through to ‘5-year technology strategy for a private higher-education provider’”
