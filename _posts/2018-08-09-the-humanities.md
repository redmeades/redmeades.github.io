This article was brought to my attention as it shows the decline in the number
of students dong humanities degrees in the US (1948-2017). There have been at
least two articles that comment on it.

It seems that employment related thinking is [likely to be behind
the decline](https://unherd.com/2018/08/oh-humanities-students-giving-arts/).
And that we are reaping what we've sown in [short-term
perspectives](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/08/opinion/oh-the-humanities.html):

> In an Apollonian culture, eager for “Useful Knowledge” and technical mastery
> and increasingly indifferent to memory and allergic to tradition, the poet and
> the novelist and the theologian struggle to find an official justification for
> their arts.

The way forward, I think, requires us to slow a little, to zoom out a lot, and
get a sense of ourselves, both individually and collectively. That is, we need,
as Ross puts it:

> a regained sense of history as a repository of wisdom and example
> rather than just a litany of crimes and wrongthink.
