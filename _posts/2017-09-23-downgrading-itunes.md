With Apples new release of iTunes they decided to do that thing that is quite annoying and removed
usable functionality and replaced it with something much poorer.

It is a poor assumption that people will want to download the same app on each of multiple devices rather
than once into iTunes and then sync that copy to their devices. Try 1 download of Keynote vs 4, especially
at 500Mb, or some games which run at over a gig. Not everyone can afford unlimited bandwidth and data.

Here's how to downgrade:
