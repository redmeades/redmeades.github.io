This is a pilot to use alternative measures of student ability as a basis for entry into Swinburne
courses. I think that this is a shift we will see more of, and that other indicators of credentialing
 like MOOC completion and Open Badges will gain consideration rather than a single figure for each unit
 of study or overall being the sole determiner.
