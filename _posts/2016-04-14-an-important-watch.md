Often we hear about privacy and encryption and think it’s a bit hard and
complicated or that it’s overblown and paranoid and in the realm of conspiracy
theories. This 45min talk by [Cory Doctorow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cory_Doctorow)
helps us to see that yes it is complex, but it can be life and death (for some) and
needs to be taken seriously and be much higher on our social and political radar
than it currently is. Because the government and many corporations have no reason
to.
