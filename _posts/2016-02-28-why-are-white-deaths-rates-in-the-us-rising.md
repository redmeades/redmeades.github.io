Interesting analysis on the increased death rate of whites aged 25 to 54 over
the past 10+ years. They suggest an answer can be found in regard to their “reference
group” - those whom they compare themselves against. These white males see themselves as
being worse off than the previous generation while other men in that age group are seeing
themselves as being better off than their reference group.
