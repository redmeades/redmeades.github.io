You can use a smartphone for the tracking of your runs, and it seems that many
have.

Alongside the above apps, one can use a dedicated device for recording data. This relieves you of running with a phone in your pocket (or on your arm if you want). I started looking into some options, and while TomTom offered a well regarded device in the Runner/Spark 3, they are getting out of the wearables business, which means that ongoing support for the device is quite limited. After reading a few reviews, Garmin's devices came up frequently. I then discovered that their [Forerunner 235](https://buy.garmin.com/en-AU/AU/p/529988) was half price over Christmas.

The [device](http://www8.garmin.com/manuals/webhelp/forerunner235/EN-US/GUID-36293482-F406-4FAF-A708-A3D9DA02E2D7-homepage.html) is designed to track running activities, with an internal GPS and can do wrist-based heart-rate monitoring. It also has support for heart-rate zones, such [as these](http://www8.garmin.com/manuals/webhelp/forerunner235/EN-US/GUID-A8716C0B-B267-4C42-B45F-B9C7928BCA19.html) which enables you to target a zone and increase your capacity in a [consistent manner](https://www.garmin.com/en-US/blog/general/get-zone-train-using-heart-rate/).

### The setup

* [Garmin Forerunner 235](https://buy.garmin.com/en-AU/AU/p/529988)
* This syncs to [Garmin Express](https://www.garmin.com/en-AU/software/express/) on the Mac
* And syncs to Garmin Connect on my phone.
* Both of these sync data to the [Garmin Connect website](https://connect.garmin.com/modern/) that has a [slew of data and analysis](https://connect.garmin.com/en-US/help/how-to/) and can [help you train more effectively](https://www.wareable.com/garmin/how-to-run-better-with-garmin-connect)
* I also use [Runkeeper](https://runkeeper.com/user/2723826284/) as a backup app and presentation site
* Garmin also supports [their own apps platform](https://apps.garmin.com/en-AU/)

#### Watch fields etc.

My current run fields are:

* Run.monitor Select (not Data or neither) <https://apps.garmin.com/en-AU/apps/9ffb4134-90af-433e-bde0-8329570bf021>
* Peter's (Race) Pacer <https://apps.garmin.com/en-AU/apps/23ea0301-30c6-4c33-b4ef-63e2b5394e76#0>

I have tried:

* Single (Run) Field <https://apps.garmin.com/en-AU/apps/640d46dd-12db-44d2-acfa-cb7eb9e840b7> presents most of the information that I am wanting.
* I was using Heart Rate and Time in Zone <https://apps.garmin.com/en-AU/apps/53505cae-a7d8-4fcb-97fa-4ad28a244d90> but I can get the times later from Connect, so I just need zones and relative time so Heart Rate Zones Chart suits <https://apps.garmin.com/en-AU/apps/4885b1e1-7102-4c66-8600-c69f911780d6#0> if a dedicated screen is needed, but Runzone BPM could work <https://apps.garmin.com/en-AU/apps/140d3379-ce7d-4851-803b-f71f7967717e>
* Maybe test Race Screen <https://apps.garmin.com/en-AU/apps/6a30651b-ca67-41a5-96dc-60634983fc93#0>
* Dozen Run <https://apps.garmin.com/en-AU/apps/9ff75afa-d594-4311-89f7-f92ca02118ad#0>
* A complex one is Run Trainer <https://apps.garmin.com/en-AU/apps/99a2bc79-fc17-4b19-adb4-1999d9b867ad#0>
* Big Font with 4 <https://apps.garmin.com/en-AU/apps/e17f6fd7-52ed-4c25-aa10-ebab2df29511>
* and On Pace <https://apps.garmin.com/en-US/apps/b47e4d38-ed64-4f54-90ff-6c689017e459#0>
