title: A permaculture journey

I've been having conversations about permaculture with my sister on and off for
a while now. And since we have started owning a house I have been thinking more
about what we can do to reduce, reuse, repurpose, recycle, etc. My understanding
of permaculture is that it basically asks 'how can we reduce what comes onto and
what goes off this property?'.

A couple of things that we are working on:

* using the pieces of wood on-site for various DIY projects - shelving small and
  large, chalkboard, fixing a table.
* mulching: an electric mulcher was left at the house and so we are using this
  to process the pruning that we are doing.
*
