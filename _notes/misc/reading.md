I listen to, and enjoy, the [Farnam Stree Podcast]() and so this article about reading by its author/host has some credence to it - [A Simple Plan to Start Reading More](https://www.lifehacker.com.au/2016/02/a-simple-plan-to-start-reading-more/). In sum:

> "It's 25 pages a day. That's it. Just commit to that, and then do it"

But then some helpful hints about [Tricking yourself into reading more](https://www.lifehacker.com.au/2017/02/how-i-tricked-myself-into-reading-more-books/)

* Create a pleasant environment
* Always carry a book with you (even on your regular drive commute)
* Give up on books
* Read a few books at a time

And this post helps with [4 memory hacks to remember what you've read](https://betterhumans.coach.me/if-you-forget-as-fast-as-you-read-this-is-for-you-afe1aaf04b7d)
