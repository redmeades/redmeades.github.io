title: understanding aspects of the flu - do I need to get jabbed?
---
I had the opportunity to get a flu shot this year and have been wondering about the value of doing it.

There is an interesting article on [surviving the next pandemic](https://www.gizmodo.com.au/2017/04/how-to-survive-the-next-catastrophic-pandemic/) of which a serious flu might be the cause.

Science has been able to [reconstruct many of the details](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/qa/1918flupandemic.htm) of the 1918 pandemic.

From there I learnt about the way in which the flu shot is an educated guess as to what types of flu are circulating and results in the efficacy of the shot [changing every year](https://www.gizmodo.com.au/2017/02/why-does-the-power-of-the-flu-shot-change-each-year/)

This got me on to [looking at protective masks](https://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/ProductsandMedicalProcedures/GeneralHospitalDevicesandSupplies/PersonalProtectiveEquipment/ucm055977.htm#s3)
