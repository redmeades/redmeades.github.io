title: Reading the Classics
---
I've been thinking about reading the classics of late and so I did some looking into the way that is done at Oxbridge.

You can read about [The Classics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classics) and [Lit Hum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literae_Humaniores).

A reading list can be found [here](https://www.balliol.ox.ac.uk/admissions/undergraduate-admissions/classics-reading-lists) and more clearly [at Kings](http://www.kings.cam.ac.uk/study/undergraduate/offerholders/reading-lists/classics.html) where the 'central classic texts' are:

* Homer Iliad (books 1â€“3 in Greek)
* Sophocles Oedipus the King
* Plato Republic (book 1 in Greek)
* Virgil Aeneid (books 1 and 2 in Latin) - Read this after you have read the Iliad and marvel at how Virgil reworks the earlier epic in Books 7-12. Books 1-6 rework the Odyssey.
* Tacitus Annals (book 1 in Latin)
* Juvenal Satires (1, 3 and 6 in Latin) - about as vicious as you can get, and not at all pc. Make sure you get an unexpurgated translation.
