I'm a procrastinator.

And I'm disadvantaged because of it.

But I've got stuff done because of it.

### Motivation

One of the factors that lends itself to procrastination is situations that are de-motivating.

In 2010 we discovered an interesting thing - what managers think motivates people is different to what people say that motivates them. The managers suggest: recognition, incentives, interpersonal support, support for making progress, and clear goals. But the data points to... **progress**:

> On days when workers have the sense theyâ€™re making headway in their jobs, or when they receive support that helps them overcome obstacles, their emotions are most positive and their drive to succeed is at its peak. On days when they feel they are spinning their wheels or encountering roadblocks to meaningful accomplishment, their moods and motivation are lowest[^1]
