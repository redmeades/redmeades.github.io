At some point in June 2017 I decided to make a habit of spending early mornings on Mount Dandenong. This began as a walk along a 5km bush trail that evolved into a run along the same path and then into 10km runs along local tracks.

I began tracking my runs using [apps on my phone](/notes/tech/apps-for-running.html) which gave me some data.

### Sites that are helpful or have specific running gear

* <http://fellrnr.com>
* <https://findyourfeet.com.au>, such as [running vests](https://findyourfeet.com.au/collections/trail-running-vest-packs)
* <https://www.salomon.com/au/>
* <https://www.patagonia.com.au>

### Diet considerations

* diet is important - here are [some foods](https://www.runtastic.com/blog/en/nutrition/optimal-performance-the-9-best-foods-for-runners/)
* particularly [eating before a workout](https://www.runtastic.com/blog/en/nutrition/11-tips-on-the-right-foods-to-eat-before-working-out/)

### Training

Once I had built up to 5k or so, tThe first area that I tackled was [cadence](https://runnersconnect.net/heelstriking-running-cadence/). The Garmin helps here, and I am getting consistent at 164-6 spm.

[heart-rate](https://philmaffetone.com/180-formula/)
I have been working on both increasing my running distance, from 5k to 10k and reducing my heart-rate to be under 'zone 5' (hence the [Garmin](running-watches.html)).

I feel comfortable at that distance, so the next phase is to train for speed and efficiency over that distance. A couple of training plans might help me be intentional here:

* <http://rapidascent.com.au/hokaoneonetrailseries/eventdetails/TrainingAndPreparation>
* <https://www.halhigdon.com/training-programs/10k-training/novice-10k/>
* <https://www.halhigdon.com/training-programs/10k-training/intermediate-10k/>

And of course there is dealing with [fatigue](https://runnersconnect.net/coach-corner/how-to-manage-fatigue-and-why-it-is-necessary/)

### Injury

I was quite careful in shifting the emphasis of the run/walk, not running downhill for months and then slowly building up my distance.

But one of the issues that developed has been IBS - [Iliotibial Band Syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iliotibial_band_syndrome). And one of the causes is running on a cambered track - as in running the same course and in the same direction which puts differing pressures on the hip area. I thought the track was relatively flat!

The good news is that you can [do stretches](http://www.sportsinjuryclinic.net/sport-injuries/knee-pain/iliotibial-band-syndrome/stretching-exercises-itb-syndrome) and [strengthening exercises](http://www.sportsinjuryclinic.net/sport-injuries/knee-pain/iliotibial-band-syndrome/strengthening-iliotibial-band-syndrome).

There are also some strengthening work you can do to [build up the hip area](https://runnersconnect.net/hips-hamstrings-and-glues-are-the-key-to-running-faster/). And maybe [foot strength](https://runnersconnect.net/is-the-secret-to-running-injury-free-foot-core/) is important.

### Routes

* A local [trail running series](http://rapidascent.com.au/TrailRunningSeries/EventDetails/overview) has the courses mapped on Google [here](https://www.google.com/maps/d/viewer?mid=1rpB1vhhZgrIr1XWPxIOaMm9r0XY&ll=-37.82905873229292%2C145.3960034957703&z=17)
* There is [one loop segment](https://www.strava.com/segments/10767033) that looks good
* The [rollercoaster run](https://www.strava.com/segments/6912126)
* There is a [nice 12k loop across the face of the Dandenongs](https://www.trailrunproject.com/trail/7034259/kalorama-doongalla-loop)

### Audacious goals

One of the things I love is being out on the trails in their wild variety of conditions. So I have been toying with the idea of going for *long* runs. Here are some links that outline the journey
