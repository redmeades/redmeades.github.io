title: what are we learning about our brains?

It seems quite common that we think that older minds are not as able to learn, change or adapt (think old dogs and new tricks or set in our ways or neural groove). But the BBC has a [great article](http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20170828-the-amazing-fertility-of-the-older-mind) on how neuro-plasticity applies to older brains and how we are finding that this common thinking is not as true as we thought. Nice to know as I get older, but less excuses!
