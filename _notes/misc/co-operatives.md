I was listening to a presentation on Co-Operatives and noted the following.

Talk from Silicon Valley about the "sharing economy" should really be labelled the "renting economy"

The idea of 'the/a commons' is growing, as are those of openness and co-operatives.

Laura mentioned 'Remixing for context' which is a very powerful idea and CC licensing allows so usefully for.

Platform co-operatives are leveraging technologies to enhance and empower the movements.
