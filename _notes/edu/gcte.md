### The first essay.

In some ways the first essay is the hard in terms of getting into writing,
setting up one's workflow, and in my case, getting the software to do the right
thing and just work.

I was under the impression that the [University of
Divinity](https://www.divinity.edu.au) used Turabian. And it seems to, but
I have found it to be the author-date style.

### Turabian
