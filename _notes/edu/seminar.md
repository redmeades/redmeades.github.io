With smaller numbers in one of my classes, I am looking at running it in a seminar mode. Here are some
notes on what that might entail.

> It has the function of bringing together small groups for recurring meetings, focusing each time on some particular subject, in which everyone present is requested to actively participate... It is essentially a place where assigned readings are discussed, questions can be raised and debates can be conducted[^1]

From a [mathoverflow exchange](http://mathoverflow.net/questions/15901/what-does-it-take-to-run-a-good-learning-seminar):

* "be willing to set the tone by asking frequent and sometimes stupid questions ... You want people in the audience to feel like they can and should understand everything that happens, and should hassle the speaker until they do understand everything"
* "We decided together what we wanted to speak about, and all the presenters are really interested in what they are speaking on. We go at exactly the pace necessary, so that everybody understands everything."
* "In my experience, informal seminars in which the presenter has sole responsibility for studying and explaining the week's reading do not work. It's better if everyone in the group reads paper X or chapter Y, and prepares for themself a list of questions/comments/worked out examples of general statements/confusions, which can be raised during the seminar meeting itself."
* "Do not assign a single presenter for next week, but rather have every active participant do the reading. Then, come next week, draw names from a hat, and whoever gets chosen gets to present"
* "Allow for a 10 minute break ... the break time can be just as productive as the presentation"
* "team presentations"
* "It is quite tightly managed, with the professor running it both picking the papers we read and giving an introductory lecture before each paper is presented."

UC Berkley suggests[^2]:

1. "Clearly establish learning goals for a seminar"
2. "when appropriate and feasible, work with the students to set the direction of the class"
3. "Ask students to write a short 'intellectual autobiography' ... to understand the variety of [student] backgrounds"
4. "Even if the material is new to most students, donâ€™t lecture in a seminar.  Depend on their doing background reading so that the time can be spent in discussion and analysis. For some topics, assign a presenter and a respondent, students who will be responsible for kicking off the discussion."
5. "Make sure that students understand the context in which this course is set"
6. "the faculty member is not only teacher, but also frequently student, as well as mentor and advisor"
