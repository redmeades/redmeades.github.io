title: Some notes on climate change and sustainability

Quite often the debate is couched in terms of the question 'is there actually
a rise in global temperatures and are humans causing it?'

But I don't think this is the best question to be asking.

A better set of questions are:

* 'Is our current activity (globally) sustainable (in terms of materials and
  particularly energy)?'
* 'If everyone on the planet lived as I or you do, what impact would that have on
  material and energy demands?'
* More critically, 'who is denying the effect of climate change and what do they
  gain by doing so?' and the corresponding 'who is affirming climate change and
  what might they gain from the shifts advocated?'
* how are we using our land? Is this sustainable over the long-term?

## burning fossil fuels

### energy

* Energy and the internet

    * Mozilla's IRL podcast [has an episode on this](https://irlpodcast.org/season5/episode3/)
    * [Greenpeace assessment of internet companies](http://www.clickclean.org/australia/en/)
    * Streaming music is [a major
      issue](https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/environmental-impact-streaming-music-835220/)

* transport

    * use public transport 
    * tyres and alignment
    * fuel: the Guardian has a [list of largest contributors](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/oct/09/revealed-20-firms-third-carbon-emissions). Caltex the worst, Mobil next, BP, then Shell. BHP makes the list.
    * regular servicing

## land use and degradation

Our land use can be a double whammy - losing vegetation that captures carbon
and replacing it with carbon producing livestock and utilising chemicals that
rely on fossil fuels.

## Actions

* purchase offsets [via CarbonFund](https://www.carbonfund.org/)
* download rather than stream all media; purchase rather than stream
* 

## Notes

The issue of reducing food and child production is not it - it is a distribution
of the current assets that is the issue.
