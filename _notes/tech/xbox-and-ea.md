So I had Battlefront and the Deluxe Edition was cheap and so we upgraded.

A whole lot of the content is online, not downloaded.

So:

* There is a [known problem](http://answers.ea.com/t5/Technical-Issues/You-are-not-allowed-to-access-online-features/td-p/4855514)
    with [linking an xbox to EA account](http://answers.help.ea.com/t5/Technical-Issues/You-are-not-allowed-to-access-online-features-on-xbox-one/td-p/4860292) - it takes the users age rather and the restriction settings for the user
* a possible solution at <http://8bitdad.com/2015/11/23/what-parents-need-to-know-about-star-wars-battlefront-get-your-kid-a-fake-id-19466/>
    but I cannot access those settings.
* <https://account.live.com/mykids.aspx> here you are supposed to be able to manage your families
    data, but I get nothing there, so I can't check or change things.
* <https://account.xbox.com/en-gb/Settings> here you can change the settings for your family accounts
    on the XBox platform and so I have allowed certain things in order to get it working.
* but it seems that you can't [change a childs DoB there](https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/outlook_com/forum/oaccount-omyinfo/how-do-i-change-the-dob-for-a-child-account/9e202b21-8b9a-4ed2-92d4-2014a2dbe0ea)
* <https://www.accountkiller.com/en/delete-ea-com-account> it seems that you can't actually get online
    and delete your EA account
* but maybe via [a phone call](https://help.ea.com/en-us/help/account/how-to-close-your-origin-account/)
* but you can [change some information](https://help.ea.com/en-us/help/account/how-to-change-your-origin-id/)
* <https://profile.microsoft.com/RegsysProfileCenter> has some details about you as a parent.
* <https://support.xbox.com/en-AU/my-account/microsoft-account/delete-information-microsoft-account> you
    can delete the data that is a part of your Microsoft account, and the whole account.
* There is a way to [unlink your GamerTag from your EA account](http://answers.help.ea.com/t5/Technical-Issues/disconnect-ea-account-from-xbox-live/td-p/5389995) but not online; you have to call them...
