The leading tool is Hypothesis

Audrey Watters is quite an open leaning person, yet has [deployed a tool to prohibit usage on her site](http://audreywatters.com/2017/04/26/no-annotations-thanks-bye).

There are many good arguments that I have been wrestling with, particularly around the idea of prohibiting annotation as analogous to prohibiting me writing in the margins of my books.

But Mike Caufield has thought it through a little more and [suggested the right metaphor](https://tinyletter.com/michaelcaulfield/letters/traces-by-mike-caulfield-3-this-week-in-webo-plasmosis) - I am not annotating **the original master manuscript** of the book, I am annotating **my copy**.

An [Annotation conference](http://iannotate.org/), [and agenda](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vyc1wncz5Blew0L95zJz6M0Xa1PkDzGe64v-CIMNZWs/edit), which had a number of sessions that addressed [opting in or out](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1diGbC1VmElh3pfmq8k6L6uz1-rWS-QHMx8kkI3qA29c/edit#), [annotation in education](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TgICwzHJah5Cz-PIyrXzSdE405By3UcWsasY7OyCXtE/edit); and also unearthed some other tools <https://paperhive.org/> and <http://www.textthresher.org/>
