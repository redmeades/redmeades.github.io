I have a [Kobo Aura H20 e-reader](https://au.kobobooks.com/products/kobo-aura-h2o).

Being waterproof is definitely an advantage - I once had a water-bottle empty
itself in my backpack which had the Kobo.

### Adobe Digital Editions

This software was giving me grief. I found [a forum post](https://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?t=288953) that indicated it could have been a Digital Editions version compatiblituy issue and so I downloaded the recommended v2.0.1. But that threw an error. I then discovered that [Kobo points to v3.0](https://www.kobo.com/help/en-US/article/5889/troubleshooting-adobe-digital-editions?products=Adobe%20Digital%20Editions) so I downloaded and installed that [direct link](http://www.adobe.com/support/digitaleditions/downloads.html). Another error. This time it was an activation issue that [Adobe address](https://helpx.adobe.com/digital-editions/kb/activation-errors-adobe-digital-editions.html), so you can re-authorize your Digital Editions and then you are able to download the content, and after copying it, your Kobo will be able to view it - yay!

### Firmware

New firmware that either fixes issues or adds functionality is made available by
Kobo group sporadically.

The forums have a [forum
thread](https://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?t=283510) and now
a [wiki page](https://wiki.mobileread.com/wiki/Kobo_Firmware_Releases) with
links to the various versions and variants for their devices which enables you
to effectively 'roll-back' to an older version should the need arise.

From the wiki, download the original firmware and then click on the patching
link.
