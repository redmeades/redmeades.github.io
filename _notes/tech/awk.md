There are a couple of brilliant command-line tools that one can use to deal with
data in text files. One of these tools is
[Awk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AWK) (The code is still available on
[Github](https://github.com/onetrueawk/awk))

* There is a [useful introduction](https://gregable.com/2010/09/why-you-should-know-just-little-awk.html).
* As [suggested on
  SO](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/107603/is-there-still-any-reason-to-learn-awk/703174#703174), read [this book on AWK](https://archive.org/details/pdfy-MgN0H1joIoDVoIC7) that is also just a great book.
