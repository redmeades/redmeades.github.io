### mac and thunderbolt/mini displayPort to HDMI

My MBA has been hooked up to a [27" Samsung monitor](http://www.samsung.com/us/business/displays/monitors/LS27D85KTSR/GO) at the office. After running into a [sleep-wake issue]() I decided to switch connections to using HDMI to see if that resolved things.

I bought a minidisplayPort to HDMI cable from Apple and plugged it in. It came up ... in 1080p. With no option to select the display's native resolution (2560 x 1440)

### Research...

* The MBA specs [indicate that it is supported](https://www.apple.com/macbook-air/specs/)
* I have confirmed that the monitor supports displayPort v1.2 and HDMI v1.4.
* The [CPU/graphics chip also supports it](http://ark.intel.com/products/84995/Intel-Core-i7-5650U-Processor-4M-Cache-up-to-3_20-GHz)
* A [review](https://www.pcworld.idg.com.au/review/samsung/series_8_s27a850t/420536/?pp=1#cb) suggested that this native resolution worked on all 3 inputs
