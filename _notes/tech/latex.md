I have been using LaTeX to output my essays since my undergraduate days. I like the clean seperation between content and styling that it provides, as well as the wonderful output quality.

(I started via the [LyX](http://lyx.org/) processor, which usefully hides some of the complexities, but then went on to using [Markdown+Pandoc]({% link _guides/text-for-text.md %}) to programmatically generate LaTeX)

The embark on this journey, you will firstly need a TeX installation, head to [the TeX Users Group site](http://tug.org/), download an installation, and read through the [getting started](http://tug.org/begin.html) document.
