## AutoSave and Recovery ##

From <http://smallbusiness.chron.com/open-autosaved-asd-files-47094.html> we learn that there are a few
ways to see that Word has auto-saved a document for you - a 'recovery pane' is displayed when you open Word if
it detects a file. Or you can go to you recent files link and select a 'Recover files' link.

Auto-save files can be littered across the filesystem as .asd files. Double-clicking on them **does not** load
Word and trigger the recovery process, you have to associate them with Word first.

See <https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/107686/how-word-creates-and-recovers-the-autorecover-files> and
MS' advice on recovering at <https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/316951/how-to-recover-a-lost-word-document>
