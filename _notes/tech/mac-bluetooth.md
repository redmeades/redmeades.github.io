title: Bluetooth on a Mac

Bluetooth on a Mac has been pretty much a non-event for me. I intentionally
don't use a Bluetooth keyboard or speakers, and so I was suprised when I found
my Bluetooth icon saying: "Bluetooth: Not Available".

You could try [removing the plist (configuration) file](https://discussions.apple.com/thread/8150033)

Or [resetting the
module](http://osxdaily.com/2015/12/15/reset-bluetooth-hardware-module-mac-osx/)
- this was not available as an option in my case.

Or you can just restart your Mac - from memory, this is one of the few times I
have needed to do this in order to solve an issue.
