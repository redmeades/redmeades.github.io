I discovered <https://archive.org>'s large collection of ms-dos games. A blast
from the past, but also something to show the kids some of the games that
I played growing up.

* The first game I can recall playing was [Castle
  Adventure](https://archive.org/details/msdos_Castle_Adventure_1984)
* [QBert](https://archive.org/details/msdos_Qbert_1984)
* [Indianapolis 500](https://archive.org/details/msdos_Indianapolis_500_The_Simulation_1989)
* [Scorch](https://archive.org/details/msdos_Scorched_Earth_1991)
* [Ski or Die](https://archive.org/details/msdos_Ski_or_Die_1990)
* [Prince of Persia](https://archive.org/details/msdos_Prince_of_Persia_1990)
* [Indycar Racing](https://archive.org/details/msdos_IndyCar_Racing_1993)
